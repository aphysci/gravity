# Doxygen filter for Google Protocol Buffers .proto files.
# This script converts .proto files into C++ style ones
# and prints the output to standard output.
#
# version 0.6-beta
#
# How to enable this filter in Doxygen:
#   1. Generate Doxygen configuration file with command 'doxygen -g <filename>'
#        e.g.  doxygen -g doxyfile
#   2. In the Doxygen configuration file, find JAVADOC_AUTOBRIEF and set it enabled
#        JAVADOC_AUTOBRIEF      = YES
#   3. In the Doxygen configuration file, find FILE_PATTERNS and add *.proto
#        FILE_PATTERNS          = *.proto
#   4. In the Doxygen configuration file, find EXTENSION_MAPPING and add proto=C
#        EXTENSION_MAPPING      = proto=C
#   5. In the Doxygen configuration file, find INPUT_FILTER and add this script
#        INPUT_FILTER           = "python proto2cpp.py"
#   6. Run Doxygen with the modified configuration
#        doxygen doxyfile

## Class for converting Google Protocol Buffers .proto files into C++ style output to enable Doxygen usage.
## 
## The C++ style output is printed into standard output.<br />
## There are three different logging levels for the class:
## <ul><li>#logNone: do not log anything</li>
## <li>#logErrors: log errors only</li>
## <li>#logAll: log everything</li></ul>
## Logging level is determined by \c #logLevel.<br />
## Error logs are written to file determined by \c #errorLogFile.<br />
## Debug logs are written to file determined by \c #logFile.
#
class proto2cpp:

  ## Logging level: do not log anything.

  ## Handles a file.
  ##
  ## If @p fileName has .proto suffix, it is processed through parseFile().
  ## Otherwise it is printed to stdout as is except for file \c proto2cpp.py without
  ## path since it's the script given to python for processing.
  ##
  ## @param fileName Name of the file to be handled.
