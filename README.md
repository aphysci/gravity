# Gravity
A high-performance software framework for rapid prototyping and development of complex, distributed systems.

## Getting started
Please see the Wiki pages for the [Gravity Build Guide](https://github.com/aphysci/gravity/wiki/GravitySetup) that describes how to build Gravity for Linux and Windows.

Then take a look at the [Gravity Examples](https://github.com/aphysci/gravity/wiki/GravityExamples) that demonstrate and explain several key features of the Gravity framework.
